# Traffic Light Simulation

This project simulates and analyzes traffic light patterns for urban traffic flow using Python. The simulation models an intersection with multiple lanes and traffic lights, generating vehicles and measuring their wait times as they pass through the intersection.

## Features

- Simulates an intersection with configurable lanes and traffic light patterns.
- Generates vehicles arriving at the intersection based on a specified arrival rate.
- Measures metrics such as average wait time and total number of vehicles processed.
- Plots the results for visual analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd traffic-light-simulation
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

Run the simulation script:
```bash
python traffic_simulation.py
