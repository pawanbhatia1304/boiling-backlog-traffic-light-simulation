# BOILING BACKLOG - TRAFFIC LIGHT SIMULATION

This project simulates the behavior of a traffic light system in an urban environment. The simulation collects data on vehicle wait times and queue lengths at a traffic light, and visualizes this data using Matplotlib. The goal of this project is to analyze traffic flow and understand the impact of traffic light patterns on urban traffic management.

## Features

- Simulates a traffic light with configurable green, yellow, and red light durations.
- Randomly generates vehicle arrivals at the intersection.
- Records vehicle wait times and queue lengths during the simulation.
- Visualizes the collected data using Matplotlib.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Required Libraries

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Code Structure

- traffic_light_simulation.ipynb : The main Python script that contains the simulation logic and visualization code.
- Data
- Output
- Demo Code Video
- README.md : This README file.

## Results
Upon running the simulation, we will see two plots that provide insights into the traffic light's performance:

- Vehicle Wait Times: This plot illustrates how long each vehicle had to wait at the traffic light.
- Queue Lengths: This plot shows the number of vehicles waiting at the traffic light during each cycle.

These visualizations can help in understanding traffic flow dynamics and the effectiveness of traffic light patterns.

## Future Work

- Implement adaptive traffic light control based on real-time traffic conditions.
- Extend the simulation to include multiple intersections and their interactions.
- Analyze the impact of different traffic volumes and light durations on overall traffic flow.
- Incorporate pedestrian behavior and crossing times into the simulation.
